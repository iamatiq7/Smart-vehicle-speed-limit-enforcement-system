# Smart-vehicle-speed-limit-enforcement-system
We are proposing a system that will use the RFID Tag vehicles, to detect over-speeding vehicles and issue the ticket by scanning the RFID tag of the violating vehicle. The proposed system includes the use of a smart speed breaker controlled by a motor to keep the speed of a vehicle in control.

### Additional information and codes are provided in the project report.
